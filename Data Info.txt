This dataset contains molecular data in a tabular format, primarily focusing on various chemical structures represented by SMILES notation and several computed properties. Here's a breakdown of its components:
Columns:

    smiles: The SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representation of the molecules, which encodes their structure in a textual format.
    E1-CC2, E2-CC2, f1-CC2, f2-CC2: These are likely computed energy or property values for the molecules under different conditions or models (E1, E2, f1, f2), potentially using a method like CC2 (Coupled Cluster theory).
    E1-PBE0, E2-PBE0, f1-PBE0, f2-PBE0: Similar to the above, but these values appear to be derived from a density functional theory (DFT) approach using the PBE0 functional.
    E1-CAM, E2-CAM, f1-CAM, f2-CAM: Again, these are likely derived from a different computational method, possibly CAM-B3LYP, a type of hybrid functional used in DFT calculations.

Data:

    Each row corresponds to a different molecule, with various computed properties following the SMILES notation.
    The values following each method represent numerical results (potentially energy values, electronic properties, or other metrics) that vary with the chemical structure.

Observations:

    The dataset includes a diverse range of molecular structures, from simple hydrocarbons to more complex functional groups.
    The values vary widely, indicating different chemical behavior or interactions based on the molecular structure and computational methods used.

This dataset is likely intended for computational chemistry analysis, providing insights into molecular properties and behaviors under different theoretical frameworks.
